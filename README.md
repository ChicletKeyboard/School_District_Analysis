# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
This analysis was conducted to replace corrupted data for 9th-grade students' math and reading scores at Thomas High School, while keeping the rest of the dataset intact for a follow-on analysis. The metrics we wanted to analyze included: total school budget, per school capita, average math and reading scores, the passing percentage of said math and reading scorres, and the overall passing percentage broken down by schools or the type of schools the students attended.

## Results
After separating the corrupted data, much of the analysis remained the same as the original report. Given that the removed section made up only a small part of the dataset, their removal did not drastically changee our analysis. Comparing the _original data__ to the updated analysis _image_ we can see the overall analysis for the district remained similar.

## Summary

The four major changes that occurred is the number of total students, the number of students counted at Thomas High School, the average math and reading scores, and the overall percentages for math and reading at Thomas High School. The removal of data implies a decrease in the count of total students overall, and total students at Thomas High School, specifically for this analysis. And since the population amount was decreased, this leads to a change in average scores and score percentages. Due to the fact that these score and percentage changes were minimal, we can assume that the removal of math and reading scores of 9th graders at Thomas High School not as significant as we would imagine it to be.

Here are how the seven school district metrics that were analyzed were changed due to the removal of the ninth-grade math and reading scores of Thomas High School:
* Total School Budget
* Per Student Budget
