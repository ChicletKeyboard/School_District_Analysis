# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
This analysis was conducted to replace corrupted data for 9th-grade students' math and reading scores at Thomas High School, while keeping the rest of the dataset intact for a follow-on analysis. The metrics we wanted to analyze included: total school budget, per school capita, average math and reading scores, the passing percentage of said math and reading scorres, and the overall passing percentage broken down by schools or the type of schools the students attended.

## Results
After separating the corrupted data, much of the analysis remained the same as the original report. Given that the removed section made up only a small part of the dataset, their removal did not drastically changee our analysis. Comparing the _original data__ to the updated analysis _image_ we can see the overall analysis for the district remained similar.

Here are how the seven school district metrics that were analyzed were changed due to the removal of the ninth-grade math and reading scores of Thomas High School:
* Top 5 performing schools based on overall passing rate
*     Basing the analysis on the overall passing rate, the 5 best schools did not change in their ranking even without the removed data. However, Thomas High School's overall passing rate did decrease from 90.95% to 90.63% after the removal of the data.
* Bottom 5 performing schools based on overall passing rate
*     There was no change in the ranking of the 5 worst-performing schools after the updated analysis was conducted.
* Average math score for each grade by school
*     Since only data from Thomas High School was removed, the average math score of other schools would be unaffected. Even so, Thomas High School's average math score changed by less than 0.2% overall.
* Average reading score for each grade by school
*     Thomas High School was thee only school that saw a changed average reading score but even that was an extremely small change (by less than 0.5%) that saw their standings compared to other schools unchanged even with the fradulent grades corrected.
* Scores by school spending
*     Student scores depending on spending per student was not affected by the removal of the corrupted data.
* Scores by school size
*     These scores were also not affected by the removal of the fradulent data.
* Scores by school type
*     There were no differences between the original and new analysis of the school district when analyzing by if a school as a charter or district school.

## Summary

The four major changes that occurred is the number of total students, the number of students counted at Thomas High School, the average math and reading scores, and the overall percentages for math and reading at Thomas High School. The removal of data implies a decrease in the count of total students overall, and total students at Thomas High School, specifically for this analysis. And since the population amount was decreased, this leads to a change in average scores and score percentages. Due to the fact that these score and percentage changes were minimal, we can assume that the removal of math and reading scores of 9th graders at Thomas High School not as significant as we would imagine it to be.
